## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the test pipeline:
```bash
cd C:/Users/user/pg_copilot/rag_cpgql
python test_pipeline_simple.py
```

Run quick experiment (2 examples):
```bash
cd experiments
python run_experiment.py --model finetuned --limit 2
```

## 📝 Notes

- All infrastructure is ready for experiments
- Merged dataset provides 2.7x more training data (27K vs 10K)
- Enriched CPG enables advanced queries with 96/100 quality score
- Enrichment-aware prompts guide LLM to use tags
- Test script verifies all components before experiments
