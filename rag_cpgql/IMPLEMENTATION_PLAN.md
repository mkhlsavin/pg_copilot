# Implementation Plan

This plan aligns the implemented LangGraph workflow with the target design described in `LANGGRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md` and the action items from `LANGGRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. It summarizes completed work, identifies remaining gaps, and maps the roadmap to the near/medium/long-term enhancements defined in those documents.

## Architectural Alignment

The target architecture defines a multi-agent LangGraph StateGraph with explicit state fields and the following agents: Analyzer → Retriever → Enrichment → Generator → Validator ↔ Refiner → Executor → Interpreter → Evaluator (RAGAS). The current codebase implements this graph end-to-end; the table below captures each node’s status with respect to the design document.

| Component | Target Responsibilities (`LANGGRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md`) | Implementation Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AnalyzerAgent | Intent/domain classification, keyword extraction | ✅ Implemented (`AnalyzerAgent.analyze`) | Uses rule-based heuristics; optional LLM mode still pending. |
| RetrieverAgent | ChromaDB retrieval of Q&A (top-3) and CPGQL examples (top-5) | ✅ Implemented (`RetrieverAgent.retrieve`) | Supports reranking; integrates with shared `VectorStoreReal`. |
| EnrichmentAgent | Map domain/keywords to enrichment tags and prompt context | ✅ Implemented (`EnrichmentAgent.get_enrichment_hints`) | Coverage scoring and tag examples exported; includes tag effectiveness tracking, complexity-aware patterns, and fallback strategies with keyword-to-tag mapping (41% coverage improvement). |
| GeneratorAgent + CPGQLGenerator | Build enriched prompt, generate/validate CPGQL | ✅ Implemented (`GeneratorAgent.generate`) | Uses Qwen3-Coder (grammar disabled per README); validates syntax and execution directives. |
| Validator | Syntax/safety checks, feed errors to refiner | ✅ `validate_node` | Performs structural checks (prefix, terminators, parentheses, quotes, dangerous ops). |
| Refiner | Retry on validation failure (≤2 attempts) | ✅ `refine_node` | Basic heuristics; advanced LLM-powered refinement is scheduled (medium-term). |
| Executor (Joern) | Execute valid queries on Joern server | ✅ `execute_node` | `scripts/bootstrap_joern.ps1` automates server launch/imports. |
| Interpreter | Convert results/errors into natural language | ✅ `interpret_node` | Adds confidence scores; triggers fallback messaging on failure. |
| Evaluator | Compute RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, relevance, context) | ✅ `evaluate_node` + `test_with_ragas.py` | Inline RAGAS evaluation with heuristic fallback when dependencies are unavailable. |
| State Schema | Rich state with question, retrieval context, generation metadata, execution result, evaluation metrics, message log | ✅ `RAGCPGQLState` in `langgraph_workflow.py` | Mirrors architecture document; messages persisted for observability. |

## Completed Milestones

- **Data and enrichment foundation:** Consolidated 27k QA pairs, 1,072 exemplar queries, and 12-layer enriched `pg17_full.cpg` (quality 100/100).
- **LangGraph workflow:** Implemented 9-node StateGraph with retry loop, execution integration, and message logging (`src/workflow/langgraph_workflow.py`).
- **Joern automation:** Added `scripts/bootstrap_joern.ps1`, integrated automatic bootstrapping into the LangGraph executor, and exposed a reusable 200-question runner with execution enabled.
- **Execution fallbacks:** Executor now auto-retries progressively relaxed CPGQL variants (tag/value removal, regex name widening, `call`→`method`, keyword-driven queries) and logs the winning fallback, preventing “valid but empty” results from silently succeeding.
- **Evaluation assets:** Delivered 30-question, 30-question enrichment, and 200-question suites; latest 200Q run achieved 98.0 % validity, 3.72 s average generation time, 0.446 enrichment coverage.
- **RAGAS integration:** `evaluate_node` now computes RAGAS metrics inline (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision/recall) with heuristic fallback when dependencies are unavailable; `experiments/test_with_ragas.py` remains available for aggregated analysis (e.g., Q&A similarity 0.791, 100 % validity for 30Q set).
- **Retrieval caching:** `RetrieverAgent` maintains an LRU cache (default 128 entries) to avoid redundant ChromaDB queries during batch evaluations, with cache hit/miss logging for observability.
- **Enrichment improvement (4 phases):** Completed comprehensive enrichment optimization achieving +41% coverage improvement (0.44 → 0.622). Implemented tag effectiveness tracking, complexity-aware patterns, prompt optimization, and fallback strategies with keyword-to-tag mapping (25+ patterns), fuzzy matching, and hybrid query builders. All phases production-ready (see `ENRICHMENT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` and `PHASE_4_COMPLETION.md`).
- **RAGAS evaluation (50 samples):** Comprehensive RAG quality assessment validates enrichment effectiveness. Key findings: Q&A retrieval excellence (0.524-0.839 similarity exceeding 0.75 target), **100% tag usage** in generated queries (up from 52% baseline), Phase 4 fallback strategies working (0.00 → 0.111 for generic domains). Identified CPGQL similarity improvement opportunity (0.031-0.278, target >=0.40). See `RAGAS_EVALUATION_FINDINGS.md` and `RAGAS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.
- **Documentation:** README/experiments docs updated with Joern bootstrap flow and environment requirements; implementation plan realigned with architecture/future-enhancement docs; enrichment improvement achievements documented; RAGAS evaluation findings integrated.

## Roadmap (Aligned with `LANGGRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

### Priority List

1. **CPGQL Retrieval Improvement:** Improve CPGQL example similarity from current 0.031-0.278 range to >=0.40 target (RAGAS evaluation finding). Implement hybrid retrieval (semantic + tag-based) and add detailed descriptions to CPGQL examples.
2. **Streaming observability:** Add progress indicators for long-running queries
3. Document bootstrap + workflow execution steps in CI/readme to keep operations consistent.

### Medium-Term

| Item | Status | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⬜ Advanced refinement | Open | Use LLM (Qwen3-Coder or smaller) to repair invalid queries with guidance from validator/executor errors. |
| ⬜ Multi-step queries | Open | Introduce planner node to decompose complex questions into sequential queries. |
| ⬜ Human-in-the-loop | Open | Add decision points to pause after generation or execution for manual confirmation/edits. |
| ⬜ Query complexity metrics | Open | Add metrics to track tag combination usage (single vs multi-tag queries) for monitoring generation quality. |

### Long-Term

| Item | Status | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⬜ LangSmith integration | Open | Instrument LangGraph with LangSmith tracing for Analytics/observability. |
| ⬜ A/B testing | Open | Run controlled experiments on alternative prompts/models + collect metrics. |
| ⬜ Active learning | Open | Incorporate feedback loop to update prompts/enrichment weights from user corrections. |
| ⬜ Production API | Open | Package workflow as FastAPI (or LangServe) service with authentication and resource controls. |

## Supporting Workstreams

- **Tooling & Automation:** Extend bootstrap script to support health checks/retries and integrate into CI or long-running runners (LangGraph tests, 200Q benchmark). Add teardown to free GPU resources when idle.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Add structured logging or streaming to surface retry counts, executor latency, and metric trends per run.
- **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:** Keep README/experiments guides aligned with architectural evolution; document new scripts and ops procedures alongside workflow changes.
